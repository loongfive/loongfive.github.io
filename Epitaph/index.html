            <div class="content">
                <p>When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits, I dreamed of changing the world. As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change,so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country.</p>
<p>But it, too, seemed immovable.</p>
<p>As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those closest to me, but alas, they would have none of it.</p>
<p>And now as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly realize: If I had only changed my self first, then by example I would have changed my family.</p>
<p>From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country and, who knows, I may have even changed the world.</p>
<p>《礼记·大学》曰：</p>
<p>古之欲明明德于天下者，先治其国；欲治其国者，先齐其家； 欲齐其家者，先修其身；欲修其身者，先正其心；欲正其心者， 先诚其意；欲诚其意者，先致其知；致知在格物；物格而后知至；知至而后意诚；意诚而后心正；心正而后身修；身修而后家齐；家齐而后国治；国治而后天下平。</p>
